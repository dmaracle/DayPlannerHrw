# DayPlannerHrw

This application will allow an individual to accurately plan their day hour by hour.

In the world today it is very common to be overwhelmed by a busy schedule so it is important that people keep their lives in order.

This app will allow you to do so with a color coordinated system. Whatever time of day it is you will know what is coming up in the schedule and what is behind you.

If someone is running late for an appointment that has not been completed yet it will appear gray, same as an appointment that has been completed.

The current hour will be highlighted in red and future events will be highlighted in green.

The schedule will save itself to the local storage of the computer being used.

This benefits the user so that they may see if they have time blocks during their day that are open or time blocks that are filled up.

At the top of the page is a date and time for the times when that information is necessary
